# CSS Grid (The ultimate layout tool)

    > Flexbox was our first layout tool in CSS.
      - It's amazing. We can do fantastic things with it, and it's super great at being flexible, but it has its limitations.

      - Flexbox only deals with 1-dimension at a time.
        - If we have "flex-direction: row;" we get columns. (We are working on the horizontal dimension)
        - If we have "flex-direction: columns;" , we get row. (We are working on the vertical dimension)

    > What if we want rows & columns?
        - We can use CSS Grid.

        - CSS Grid enables us to create grid, that means we can work on both vertical and horizontal axis at the same time!
        - This opens up new layout possibilities that we simply didn't have before.
        - It also enables us to simplify our markup.
        - It's great because we don't have to think so hard about how content need to be grouped, resulting in much "flatter" HTML.

    > It does come with some added complexity too.
